# Student SAT-GPA Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between students' SAT scores and their corresponding GPA scores. The dataset used contains information on students' SAT scores, GPA scores, and additional random variables.

## Project Structure
- `studentgrades.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset.
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements
To run the analysis, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Running the Analysis
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the command `jupyter notebook`.
4. Open the `analysis.ipynb` notebook.
5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the analysis step by step.

## Results
The analysis reveals a significant linear relationship between students' SAT scores and their GPA scores. As SAT scores increase, GPA scores also tend to increase, indicating a positive correlation between the two variables.

## Future Work
Future work could involve exploring additional factors that may influence students' GPA scores, such as study habits, extracurricular activities, or socioeconomic background.
